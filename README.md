**About the project**

The project is now in progress for more than a year â€“ and still not ready :/. Selfmail uses Rspamd to filter through spam, RabbitMQ for sending and receiving emails, Typescript as the main programming language and React (and for some packages NextJS) for the frontend. The project contains more than 15k lines of code.
