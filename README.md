### Selfhosting

> [!NOTE]
> Selfmail does not have an installation script for speeding up the process. Contributions are welcomed for a selfhosting script.

**Prerequisite:**

- [Docker](https://docker.com)
- Docker Compose
- A Reverse Proxy (for example [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)


You also need a **Server** (for example an VPS) with **access** to **port 25** and **port 587**. Both ports are often abused for spamming attacks, please ask your provider, whether they can enable you the ports, if they are blocked.
