Selfmail is an open-source business first email provider, focused on simplicity and privacy. Selfmail is currently in an very early preview phase. The entire email provider is open-source, available on GitHub and selfhostable. A pricing model will come, when we'll go into our first beta.

## Why Selfmail?

There are a ton of email providers out there, so why use Selfmail?

- **Free to use**: Selfmail is completely free to use, with no hidden costs or fees. You can use Selfmail for as long as you want, without any limitations.
- **Open-source**: Selfmail is open-source, meaning you can inspect the code, contribute to it, and even selfhost it if you want to.
- **Privacy-focused**: Selfmail is built with privacy in mind. We do not track you, we do not sell your data, and we do not show you ads.
- **Business-first**: Selfmail is designed for businesses. We offer features like custom domains, team management, and more.

This sounds great, right? We would never sell your data to third parties, nor would we show you ads. We believe in a free and open internet, and we want to contribute to that vision.

## Pricing

Selfmail is not yet in a production mode, this means, we **do not have a pricing model yet**. When we go into our first beta, we will introduce a pricing model. Until then, Selfmail is completely free to use. Future plans would look like the following ones:
