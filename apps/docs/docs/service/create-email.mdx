# How to create an email
Emails should be created with the `createEmail` function. This function takes a `userId` and a `content` object. The `content` object is the same as the `content` object in the [create message](/docs/service/create-message) function.

```ts
import { createEmail } from "database";

const email = await createEmail(userId, {
  subject: "Hello",
  content: {
    text: "Hello world",
  },
});
```
