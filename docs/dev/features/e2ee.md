E2EE in Selfmail is going to be an optional pro features. Once enabled, inboxes are going to be end-to-end encrypted, so that it's not possible for us, nor any other third party services, to view your emails. E2EE inboxes are excluded from collaborator (due to technical limitations) and extended search as well as ai features. You can remove this feature from your inbox at any time, please note that emails received or sent with e2ee on, are never going to be decrypted on our servers. That means, these emails are never going to be able to be found with the ai features or extended search features.
