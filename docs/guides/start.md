## 🏁 Get started

We try to make it as easy as possible to get started with selfmail. You can register for the hosted version of selfmail [here](https://app.selfmail.app/register). You can create a new email adresse with the "email" InputDeviceInfo. This will be your main adresse. This means all of the actions you do with selfmail, and the email adresse with is mostly shown in your account will be this. This adresse is not editable which means you can't change it and have to think carefully about the adresse.

## 📝 Send your first email

Under the link "Send email" in the sidebar of the dashboard, you can go to a page which is dedicated to sending emails. You'll see a big WYSIWYG editor where you can write your email even with the typical markdown syntax. You can add images via the upload function which can be found in the top right corner, in the toolbar.

## 🎉 Receive emails

You will receive emails in your inbox. Emails from all over your adresses will go in the main adresses, you can also filter them by name, subject, and date. If you want to see the emails of a specific adresse, you can click on the adresse in the sidebar.

## 📝 Reply to emails

If you want to reply to an email, you can click on the reply button in the top right corner of the email. You can also reply to an email by clicking on the reply button on the email itself in the data table.
