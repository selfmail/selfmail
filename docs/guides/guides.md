## 📝 Guides

We provide a set of guides to help you get started with selfmail. These guides are written in markdown and can be found in the `docs/guides` folder. Some of the guides are made by the community, this means we are not responsible for the content of these guides. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to us. You can also create your own guide through the "guide" guide. After you created your guide, you can add it with a pull request to this repository. We are happy to review your guide and provide feedback.

You can create your own guides by adding a new file to the `docs/guides` folder. The file should be named `guide-name.md`. The file should contain the following structure:
